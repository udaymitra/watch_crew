  description: >
    Analyze the watch search results from all searched sites for
    "{watch_query}" and provide comprehensive pricing insights.

    Sites searched: {sites_searched}

    Analysis steps:
    1. Price statistics per site per condition (min, max, median, average)
    2. Cross-site comparison: which seller is cheaper for new? For used?
    3. New vs used premium percentage on each site
    4. Factor in shipping costs for true total cost comparison
    5. Identify the single best new listing across all sites
    6. Identify the single best used listing across all sites
    7. Identify the overall best deal regardless of condition
    8. Flag any pricing anomalies (suspiciously low, much higher than peers)
    9. Provide a clear new vs used recommendation with reasoning
